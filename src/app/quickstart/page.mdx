# Quickstart

This guide will get you set up and ready to use the TIRMS API. We'll cover how to authenticate your requests and make your first API call. {{ className: 'lead' }}

<Note>
  Before you can make requests to the TIRMS API, you will need to get your
  API key from the TIRMS portal. Contact your system administrator to obtain access.
</Note>

## Authentication Setup

Before making your first API request, you need to set up authentication. The TIRMS API uses API key-based authentication.

### Get Your API Key

1. Contact your system administrator to obtain access to the TIRMS portal
2. Log into the TIRMS portal with your credentials
3. Navigate to the API settings section
4. Generate a new API key for your application

### Set Up Your Environment

Store your API key securely in your environment variables:

```bash
export TIRMP_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```

## Making Your First API Request

Now you're ready to make your first call to the TIRMS API. Below, you can see how to send a POST request to verify a phone number status.

### Phone Number Verification Example

```bash {{ title: 'cURL' }}
curl -X POST https://tirmp.comsoftltd.net/api/v1/phone/api/phone-numbers/verify \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"phoneNumber": "08012345678"}'
```

### Response Example

```json
{
  "status": "Success",
  "data": {
    "phoneNumber": "08012345678",
    "status": "NORMAL",
    "requestId": "3ddde7f7-e979-4ed6-9e1a-5c947133c887",
    "mobileNetwork": "MTN",
    "verificationTimestamp": "2025-01-15T10:30:00.000Z"
  },
