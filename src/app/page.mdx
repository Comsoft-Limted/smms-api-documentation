# Prerequisite
Before integrating with the SMMS API, ensure the following requirements are in place: {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Onboarding and Registeration {{ className: 'mt-0'}}
- Your organization must be registered and approved by the SMMS system administrator.
- API access credentials (API key) will be issued upon successful onboarding.

## API Key Generation {{ className: 'mt-0'}}

- An administrator from your organization must log into the SMMS portal to generate an API key.
- Keep this key secure; it will be used in the Authorization header for every API request.

## Webhook Setup (for Bulk Verification) {{ className: 'mt-0'}}

- If you intend to use the bulk verification endpoint, set up a secure and accessible webhook URL to receive asynchronous results. The webhook can be configured via the SMMS platform.

## MSISDN Format Compliance {{ className: 'mt-0'}}

- All phone numbers must be submitted in the 11-digit MSISDN format (e.g., 08012345678), based on the E.164 standard without the '+' symbol.

## Network and Security Readiness {{ className: 'mt-0'}}

- Ensure outbound HTTPS traffic is allowed from your system to the SMMS API endpoints.
- Use secure HTTPS (TLS) communication at all times.

## Development Environment Access {{ className: 'mt-0'}}

- For testing, request access to the SMMS sandbox environment to simulate API requests and verify your integration.

## Development Team Familiarity {{ className: 'mt-0'}}

- Your developers should be familiar with RESTful API principles, JSON payload structures, and handling common HTTP status codes.



# Introduction {{ className: 'mt-20'}}

The Safeguarding Mobile Money Services (SMMS) API enables centralized verification and status updates of mobile phone numbers. This documentation covers the two available endpoints: Phone Number Status Verification and Phone Number Status Update. It includes authentication guidance, response schemas, error handling, and best practices. {{ className: 'lead' }}

  </Button>
</div>

# Authentication

All API calls require API Key-based authentication. The API key must be included in the Authorization header for every request. 
Admins can generate API keys for their accounts directly from the platform. {{ className: 'lead' }}

<div className="not-prose">
<Row>
  <Col>
    ```json {{ title: 'Example header' }}
    { "Authorisation": "Bearer <token>" }
    ```
  </Col>
</Row>
</div>

Tokens are provided to each registered entity during onboarding by the system administrator. {{ className: 'lead' }}

# Glossary {{className: 'mb-5 mt-14'}}

- **MSISDN:** Mobile Subscriber Integrated Services Digital Network Number (11 digits)
- **API Key:** Security passed in headers for authorization 
- **Reassigned Date:** The date the phone number was officially deactivated from its previous user and reallocated to a new user by the telecom operator.
- **Churned:** Number has been recycled and/or reassigned due to dormancy
- **Swapped:** Sim has been replaced due to loss/theft/damage 
- **Blacklisted:** Number has been blocked/barred
- **Null/Normal:** Number not in any of the above states

# API endpoints {{ className: 'mb-5 mt-10'}}

## Phone Number Status Update Endpoint.

Purpose: This endpoint allows telecom operators to update the status of a mobile phone number in the SMMS database. It ensures that service providers across platforms have access to the most current status—such as whether a number has been blacklisted, churned, swapped, or is valid (Null/Normal)—for risk mitigation and fraud prevention. {{ className: 'lead' }}

<hr className='py-0'/>

**When to Use:** {{className:'lead'}}
- After phone number is   
- Before initiating sensitive transactions.
- Periodic checks to ensure ongoing validity of stored numbers.

**Phone Number Status Update Request Schema:**
<div className="mb-10">
<CodeGroup>

```json {{ language: 'js' }}
{ 
    "phoneNumber": "+2348001234567", 
    "status": "Blacklisted, Churned, Null/Normal, Swapped", 
    "remarks": "string" 
}
```
</CodeGroup>

    }
}
```
</CodeGroup>
</div>

## Phone Number Status Update (bulk) Endpoint.
Allows authorized users to update the status of multiple phone numbers. {{className: 'lead'}}

**Purpose:** This endpoint allows authorized operators (telecom providers or other designated entities) to update the status of multiple phone numbers at once in the SMMS system. For example, suppose several numbers become churned, swapped, or blacklisted.. In that case, the operator can submit those updates in bulk to ensure accurate and up-to-date records for downstream service providers. {{className:'lead'}}

**Sample Request Payload**
<div className="mb-10">
<CodeGroup>

```json {{ language: 'js' }}
{ 
   "updates": [
    {
      "phoneNumber": "string",
      "status": "string",
      "remarks": "string"
    }
  ]
}
```
</CodeGroup>
</div>

**Sample Response**
<div className="mb-10">
<CodeGroup>

```json {{ language: 'js' }}
{ 
  {
    "status": "string",
    "data": "string",
    "statusCode": "string"
  }
}
```
</CodeGroup>
</div>


## Phone Number Status Verification Endpoint

**Purpose:** Before a service provider onboards a user or allows them to perform sensitive operations (like opening an account, initiating transactions, or resetting passwords), they should confirm that the phone number is safe to use. {{ className: 'lead' }}

This endpoint checks the current status of the phone number in the SMMS database. {{className:'lead'}}

When to Use: {{className:'lead'}} 

- During user onboarding
- Before initiating sensitive transactions.
-  Periodic checks to ensure ongoing validity of stored numbers.

## Process flow:

1. Send a POST request with the phone number.
2. The API returns the current status of the number:
    - **Churned** →  Stop the process; the number now belongs to a new user (potential fraud risk).
    - **Blacklisted** → Stop the process; the number is no longer in use.  
    - **Swapped** → Indicates that the SIM card associated with the phone number has been replaced—typically due to loss, theft, or damage. While the number may still belong to the same user, this status may warrant additional verification to ensure the user's identity and prevent potential misuse.  
    - **Null/Normal** → Number either not found or does not exist i any of the states listed above.


## Sample Request

# Security Considerations
- All API calls must be over HTTPS.
- Never expose API keys in frontend applications.
- Rotate keys regularly or immediately if compromised.
- Monitor logs for abuse.

# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) {{className: 'mt-10'}}
1. **How do I get an API key?** <br />
API keys can be generated from the SMMS portal. {{className: 'lead'}}

2. **Can I use the same API key across multiple services?** <br />
Yes, but it’s best practice to use separate keys for production, testing, and environments requiring different access levels. {{className: 'lead'}}

3. **What phone number format should I use in requests?** <br />
You should use the MSISDN format based on the E.164 standard (without the + symbol) for all phone numbers in your API requests. {{className: 'lead'}}

4. **What does 'Null/Normal' mean in the verification response?** <br />
Null/Normal indicates that the phone number does not fall under any defined status—such as churned, swapped, or blacklisted. It may also mean that the number has not yet been registered or updated in the SMMS database. {{className: 'lead'}}

5. **How frequently is the data updated?** <br />
As frequently as possible. {{className: 'lead'}}

6. **What happens if I try to update a number I'm not authorized to manage?** <br />
If you attempt to update the status of a phone number that you are not authorized to manage, the system will reject the request and return an authorization error. Only registered telecom operators can update numbers within their allocated ranges. Unauthorized access attempts are logged and monitored for security and compliance purposes. {{className: 'lead'}}

7. **Is batch verification supported?** <br />
Yes, batch verification is supported via the Bulk Verification endpoint. Organizations can submit multiple phone numbers in a single request. While the API will acknowledge receipt of the request, the verification results for each number will be sent asynchronously to the webhook provided by the requesting organization. {{className: 'lead'}}

8. **What should I do when I hit the rate limit?** <br />
If you hit the rate limit (429 error), wait before retrying. {{className: 'lead'}}

9. **What if I send an invalid status in an update request?** <br />
If your update request contains an invalid or missing status value, the system will reject the request and return a 400 Bad Request error. The response will include a clear message indicating the issue. {{className: 'lead'}}

10. **Is there a sandbox for testing?** <br />
Yes, SMMS provides a sandbox environment for testing integrations before going live. The sandbox allows you to simulate requests (e.g., verification and status updates) without affecting production data. You’ll receive mock responses that help validate your implementation. {{className: 'lead'}}
To request access to the sandbox, please contact the SMMS onboarding or support team. {{className:'lead'}}
