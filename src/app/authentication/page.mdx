# Authentication

All API calls to the TIRMS API require **API Key-based authentication**. The API key must be included in the `Authorization` header for every request. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Getting Your API Key

API keys can be generated from the TIRMS portal by an administrator from your organization. Keep this key secure; it will be used in the Authorization header for every API request.

## Authentication Header

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header using the Bearer token format:

```bash {{ title: 'Example request with API key' }}
curl https://tirms.ncc.gov.ng/api/v1/phone/api/phone-numbers/verify \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"phoneNumber": "08012345678"}'
```

## Security Best Practices

- **Never expose API keys** in frontend applications or client-side code
- **Rotate keys regularly** or immediately if compromised
- **Use HTTPS** for all API requests
- **Monitor logs** for any unauthorized access attempts

## Error Responses

If authentication fails, you'll receive one of these error responses:

- **401 Unauthorized**: Missing or invalid API key
- **403 Forbidden**: Insufficient permissions for the requested operation

```json {{ title: 'Example authentication error' }}
{
  "error": {
    "code": 401,
    "message": "Invalid API key",
    "details": "The provided API key is not valid or has expired"
  }
}
```
